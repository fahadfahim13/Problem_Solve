## Question
A palindrome is a word that reads the same backward or forward. <br />
Write a function that checks if a given word is a palindrome. Character case should be ignored. <br />
For example, `is_palindrome("Deleveled")` should `return True` as character case
should be ignored, resulting in **"deleveled"**, which is a palindrome since it
reads the same backward and forward.
```python
def is_palindrome(word):
    return None
print(is_palindrome('Deleveled'))
```
